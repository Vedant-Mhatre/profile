Software engineer with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

My journey began in 2014 when I started tinkering with Linux and Android. Over the next few years explored various domains like cyber security, backend engineering, and DevOps.

Currently focusing on backend engineering and DevOps.

When I'm not behind the screen, you'll find me testing my skills at the poker table, exploring Mumbai's culinary and cultural gems, traversing new landscapes, or indulging in a binge-watching marathon of the latest TV shows and movies.
