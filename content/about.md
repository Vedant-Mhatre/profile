Software engineer who wants to solve real world problems using technology. Currently, working at [Hiver](https://hiverhq.com/).

Started my journey in 2014 by tinkering around linux, android, custom android kernels and frameworks to optimise OS. Over the next few years explored various domains like cyber security, web development, backend engineering and DevOps.
