Amid the rigors of my last semester as an undergraduate, I often found myself daydreaming about a serene escape. Kashmir had always been a place I'd heard so much about, yet never had the chance to visit. The majestic tales of its unparalleled beauty and tranquil landscapes drew me in. I imagined a haven away from the deadlines and study sessions, a respite where I could recharge and immerse myself in the pristine beauty of nature. This wasnâ€™t about checking off tourist hotspots; I yearned for a vacation where I could truly disconnect and find peace.

Upon landing, instead of heading straight to our hotel, we made an impromptu decision to visit the Tulip gardens. The looming possibility of rain urged us to seize the moment. As we wandered through, we were greeted by a mesmerizing array of tulips in every conceivable color, their beauty magnified by the imminent storm clouds.

After our enchanting experience at the Tulip gardens, we journeyed to Sonamarg. This serene locale, untouched by urban chaos, proved to be the perfect retreat from the frenetic pace of city life.

In Sonamarg, our adventures led us to the breathtaking Thajiwas glacier. There, I experienced the exhilaration of skiing for the very first time. The sensation was unparalleled, and I'd wholeheartedly recommend everyone to give it a try at least once in their lifetime.
